Task 3:

Why do we use concurrent execution (multithreading/multiprocessing, or the like)? List a fair few reasons.
-	 Virtually all real-time systems are inherently concurrent devices operate in parallel in the real world


How can adding more concurrent tasks make programming simpler? 

And how can it make programming more difficult?
