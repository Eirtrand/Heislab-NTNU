Task 3:

Why do we use concurrent execution (multithreading/multiprocessing, or the like)? List a fair few reasons.
-	 saa og si alle sanntidssystemer bruker kjører programmer paralelt?
- 	 utnytte moderne cpuer som har flere tråder

How can adding more concurrent tasks make programming simpler? 

And how can it make programming more difficult? 

Task 4:
What are the differences between processes, threads, green threads, and coroutines?
